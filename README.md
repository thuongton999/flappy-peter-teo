## Installation and Usage

### Using terminal (on Window)
Make sure you installed [Python](https://python.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) before, you can check that by copy and paste this to your terminal
```
python --version
git --version
```
It will log something like `Python 3.x.x` and `git version x.x.x.<CurrentOS>.x`, now you can continue.
